## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Get the two values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable 
### Step 3: 
Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable.
### Step 4:  
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable
### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be interchanged
### Step 6:

## PROGRAM:
```
Val1=input("Enter the First value: ")
Val2=input("Enter the Second value: ")
print(f"The First Value is {Val1} and the Second Value is {Val2}")
print("After Swaping")
Val1,Val2=Val2,Val1
print(f"The First Value is {Val1} and the Second Value is {Val2}")
```
## RESULT:
Thus the swapping of two values are successfully executed
